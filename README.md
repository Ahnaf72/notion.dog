**To get a short and sleek subdomain for your own Notion website follow these 4 Steps:**

### Step 0 -   Star This Repo ‚≠ê
Star This Repo !  üòâ üòâ

### Step 1 -  Prerequisite üóíÔ∏è
Enable **Public Access** on your desired pages through Notion's Share menu.

### Step 2 -  Choose your subdomain üí°
Now determine your notion.dog subdomain: either choose your username or the name according to your Notion website (for example, either ```foo.notion.dog``` or ```bar.notion.dog``` would be possible).

### Step 3 -  [IMPORTANT] Add a JSON data file to this repo  üìå
üèÆ Add a JSON data file named ```[your-subdomain].json``` into the [```your.notion.dog``` folder](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/tree/main/your.notion.dog) of this repo.
> examples: [aaron.json](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/blob/main/your.notion.dog/aaron.json "aaron.json")    , [amyrogers.json ](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/blob/main/your.notion.dog/amyrogers.json "amyrogers.json ").

 üí° When your JSON file is named` foo.json`,  the finally URL would be `https://foo.notion.so`.


‚úèÔ∏è  **Configue everything in your JSON file**, such as home page, URL slugs,custom google fonts, custom javascript code, page title, meta description and more. Please refer to the demo file [amyrogers.json ](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/blob/main/your.notion.dog/amyrogers.json "amyrogers.json ") to figure out how to get it done , it's easy to understand.  üòâ

üìå **IMPORTANT: please  make sure your JSON file is valid and correct in JSON syntax before you move forward!** A [JSON Checker](https://jsonchecker.com/ "JSON Checker") would be help.

### Step 4 - Make a pull request ‚ú®
To finish the procedure, make a pull request in this GitHub repository that adds your subdomain JSON file to the the [```your.notion.dog``` folder](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/tree/main/your.notion.dog). 

Your website should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a naming conflict or a incorrect JSON syntax).
